# strava_activity_names
I want to build a tool which automatically renames activities when they are uploaded. Maybe with AI?


It works :)

Target user story 1: As a user I want the activty to be automagically and creativelly renamed when it is uploaded.

Next steps: 
1. Build some sort of event listener, which triggers the renaming as soon as it is uploaded
2. Feed the activity information to a genAI API and ask for a creative name for this activity
